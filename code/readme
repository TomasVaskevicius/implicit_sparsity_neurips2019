Code structure.

1) ./ --- All the code related to our algorithms.
2) ./core/ --- Our mini-framework for running simulations.
3) ./model.py --- Implementation of our reparameterization.
4) ./observers/hyperparameters_tuning.py --- Implementation
        of an increasing step size scheme and initial step size tuning.
5) ./simulation_parameters.py --- A class controlling the
        parameters of simulation to be performed.
6) ./running/ --- Code for running the simulations described in our paper.
7) ./plotting/ --- Code for generating the plots after running the simulations.

Reproducing simulations.

First edit the python source code for all files in the
./running/ directory with the device ids on which simulations
are to be performed. Then, execute the following from the
code directory.

chmod +x run_all.sh & ./run_all.sh

After the simulations have finished running, execute

chmod +x plot_all.sh & ./plot_all.sh

The figures will appear in the ./figures directory.
